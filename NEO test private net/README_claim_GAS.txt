How to claim GAS:

(This is all done in neo-gui2.9.1\neo-gui.exe)

Each time you want to claim more GAS, you must send yourself NEO, which will generate GAS, which you can then claim. The instructions are as follows:

1. Open neo-gui2.9.1\neo-gui.exe
2. Open a wallet
3. Right-click on a Standard Account --> Copy to Clipboard, to copy the address to clipboard
4. Click Transaction --> Transfer...
5. Add that same address (the one you just copied, i.e. yourself) into the Recipient List, and click OK to initiative the transfer.
6. Now, click Advanced --> NeoGas Claim...
7. Click "Claim All" (you might have to wait a while for the GAS to get generated first).
